# FIFO-RTL-Design-and-Verification-project
 Designed synchronous FIFO using Verilog HDL and successfully conducted the verification process HDL Language Used: verilog

# FIFO RTL Design and Verification

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements and verifies a **synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** memory in **Verilog HDL**.  
FIFO acts as a queue â€” the first data written is the first to be read. It is widely used in buffering, data transfer between systems, and clock domain crossing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Synchronous FIFO design.
- Configurable data width and depth.
- **Full** and **Empty** flag generation.
- Overflow and underflow handling.
- Testbench with self-checking verification.
- Simulation waveform analysis.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Verilog HDL
- **Simulator:** Icarus Verilog / ModelSim / VCS
- **Waveform Viewer:** GTKWave
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

 Test Cases
The testbench verifies:

âœ… Normal write and read operation.

âœ… Overflow prevention.

âœ… Underflow prevention.

âœ… Data order preservation.

âœ… Reset functionality.
